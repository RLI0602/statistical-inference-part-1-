Statistical Inference Assignment Part One 
Overview: In this project I will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.  To be specifc, I will solve three questions: First, Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
Second, Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution. Third, Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
Simulation: 
Set the variables as defined in the Assignment.
lambda <- 0.2
n <- 40;
numsim<-2000 
set.seed(234)
data <- matrix(rexp(numsim * n, rate=lambda), numsim);
data_means <- apply(data, 1, mean);
hist(data_means, col="green");
1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
theoretical_mean <- 1/lambda;
print (paste("Theoretical center of the distribution = ", theoretical_mean)); 
print (paste("Actual center of the distribution based on the simulations = ", round(mean(data_means), 3)));
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
theoretical_var <- (1/lambda)^2/n; 
theoretical_sd <- 1/lambda/sqrt(n);
print (paste("Theoretical variance = ", theoretical_var));
print (paste("Actual variance based on the simulations = ", round(var(data_means), 3)));
print (paste("Theoretical standard deviation = ", round(theoretical_sd, 3)));
print (paste("Actual standard deviation based on the simulations = ", round(sd(data_means), 3)));
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
plotdata <- data.frame(data_means);
        m <- ggplot(plotdata, aes(x = data_means)); 
        m <- m + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="black", 
                                fill = "green")
        m + geom_density(colour="blue", size=1);
To answer question 3, you can observe the that the Central Limit Theory is working here to make the actual data follow a normal curve by observing the shape of the actual data on the graph shown in green as compared to the normal curve shown in blue.
Summary: 
After the simulation, we now know that Theoretical mean is 5 while samle mean is 5.017; Theoretical variance is 0.625 and standard deviation is 0.791 while Actual variance based on the simulations is 0.663 and its standard deviation based on the simulations is 0.814 and the the distribution is approximately normal based the graphic shown as above
